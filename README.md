In the year of 1950, a given city has 100,000 inhabitants. A dam with a capacity of 5,000,000,000m3 of water produces hydroelectric energy for the whole city. In the region, two rainy seasons take place in each year. In the first season, the rains add 2,000,000,000m3 of water to the dam, while in the second they add 1,500,000,000m3. In the beginning of 1950, the dam is full and each inhabitant consumes on average 10kWh of energy per month. Each kWh of energy requires 100m3 of water to be produced. The consumption of energy increases an average of 5% per inhabitant each year.


This Lua script uses [TerraME](http://www.terrame.org/packages/doc/base/doc/index.html) framwork in order to simulate the consumption of energy per year considering those variables.
